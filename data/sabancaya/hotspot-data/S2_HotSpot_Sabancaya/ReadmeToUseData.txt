CONTENT OF THE FILE
S2_HotSpot.csv file contains thermal, spatial and quantitative information about hot spot detection at the volcano of interest, using SWIR SENTINEL2 MSI satellite images.
S2_HotSpot.csv contains 8 columns:
1) Date of Imageâ€™s acquisition (UTC Time);
2) Number of Hot Pixel(s) detected in the image (10 x 10 km) (nb.);
3) Thermal Index of Hot Pixel(s) (Mean Value, adimensional);
4) Thermal Index of Hot Pixel(s) (Max Value, adimensional);
5) Distance Max of Hot Pixel(s) from volcano summit (meters);
6) Distance Max of Hot Pixel(s) in a box of 2x2 km around the volcano summit (meters);
7) Number of Hot Pixel(s) in a box of 2x2 km around the volcano summit (nb.);
8) Number of Cluster(s) of Hot Pixel(s) (nb.)
