# Predicting Volcano Eruption
## Names: 
- Jude Lowe, Lucas Holt, Jack Logan

- Use Geophysical Data to predict when Volcano Eruptions might occur
- Geophysical methods are used to observe what is going on under the surface and can be used to see what volcanic processes occur
## Problem Statement
- How can geophysical data help predict volcanic activity and eruptions
## Data Sets

## Tools/Packages
- obspy
- seisbench
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib?
## Planned Methodology
- use previous eruptions to determine which geophysical properties change and how
- train a model to use these changes and predict an eruption?
## Expected Outcomes
