# Predicting Volcano Eruption
## Names: 
- Jude Lowe, Lucas Holt, Jack Logan

- Use Geophysical Data to predict when Volcano Eruptions might occur
- Geophysical methods are used to observe what is going on under the surface and can be used to see what volcanic processes occur
## Problem Statement
- How can geophysical data help predict volcanic activity and eruptions
## Data Sets
- [Mirova DB for heat](https://www.mirovaweb.it/)
- [Smithsonaion DB for eruptions](https://volcano.si.edu/database/search_eruption_results.cfm)
- [Deforamtion DB](https://comet.nerc.ac.uk/comet-volcano-portal/volcano-index/Search-All)
## Tools/Packages
- obspy
- seisbench
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib?
## Planned Methodology
- use previous eruptions to determine which geophysical properties change and how
- train a model to use these changes and predict an eruption?
## Expected Outcomes
