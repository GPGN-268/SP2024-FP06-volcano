# Predicting Volcano Eruption
## Names: 
- Jude Lowe, Lucas Holt, Jack Logan

- Use Geophysical Data to predict when Volcano Eruptions might occur
- Geophysical methods are used to observe what is going on under the surface and can be used to see what volcanic processes occur
## Problem Statement
- What trends can we observe in geophysical data before, during, and after a volcanic eruption period?
## Data Sets
- [Mirova DB for heat](https://www.mirovaweb.it/)
- [Smithsonaion DB for eruptions](https://volcano.si.edu/database/search_eruption_results.cfm)
- [Deforamtion DB](https://comet.nerc.ac.uk/comet-volcano-portal/volcano-index/Search-All)
## Tools/Packages
- obspy
- seisbench
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib?
## Planned Methodology
- Examine an eruption case using heat, gas emissions, seismic, and deformation data.
- Determine how these properties change over time.
## Expected Outcomes
- We expect heat, emissions, deformation, and seismic activity to increase leading up to an eruption.
- We also expect these properties to decrease following eruption.
- How will the post-eruption data compare to pre-eruption?
